### 📌 About Fuzzy Tsukamoto

The **Tsukamoto method** is a type of fuzzy inference system where each rule's output is represented by a fuzzy set with a monotonic membership function. The final result is calculated using the weighted average of the output values.

This model is ideal for systems that need **graded, human-like reasoning**—perfect for customer service, recommendation systems, and quality control.
